## Project Proposal - Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is an enterprise level distributed RESTful search engine based on Apache lucene. It is open source, highly scalable and provides very fast near real time searches. Elastic search can be used to search all types of documents. It is primarily developed in Java and comes with a powerful REST API interface. The Elasticsearch REST APIs are accessed using JSON over HTTP. Elasticsearch supports plug-in development in a wide variety of languages.

The basic concepts of the Elasticsearch that are discussed in the [Elasticsearch concepts]( https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_basic_concepts.html) page.   

The benefits of Elasticsearch in terms of query is it will let you to combine and perform many different types of searches like structured as well as the unstructured searches. It also helps in working upon the data which is based on geography and on metrics so irrespective of what type of data you have been used it will perform efficiently. Elasticsearch helps in analyzing the billions of log lines easily and provides aggregations which help you zoom out to explore trends and patterns in your data like show files where place is Chicago, aggregates data by days, aggregates data by geography and other different patterns. 

The main advantages of Elasticsearch are scalability, fast, multilingual, document oriented, autocompletion & instant search, schema free. 


### Contributors

Users must sign a contributor license agreement as an individual user or a company there by ensuring that elastic search has right to use your work and distribute your work. Once signed you cannot withdraw from the agreement. Since it is an open source software anyone can contribute to the project in the [Elasticsearch GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) page. The contributors must follow the [contribution instructions](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) mentioned in their project open source page.

From the below graph we can analyze the number of people contributing to the Elasticsearch since 2010 to till month. These statistics are from the Elasticsearch GitHub open source repository. From the graph we can observe the increase in the number of contributors for this repository every year.

### Activity

Since the time it is developed, Elasticsearch has skyrocketed every year and is now currently one of the leading providers. 
This project has nearly 50,000 commits by around 2,000 contributors and over a 2.5 million lines of code. These statistics are analyzed from the [Elasticsearch GitHub page](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). 
The below statistics are according to the another opensource repository of Elasticsearch [Elasticsearch open hub source page](https://www.openhub.net/p/elasticsearch)

### Popularity

There are many organizations that are using Elasticsearch products such as eBay, Vimeo, Fermi lab, Air bus, SAP concur, Lyft, IEEE Global spec, Citi bank, fit bit and many other organizations. We can see the increase in the popularity of Elasticsearch from year to year since the time it is developed. Since it is an open source free, this product popularity has been increased worldwide. The benefits like powerful API, it searches everything, fast search, easy to scale, restful service, many great search engine features and many other features are keeping Elasticsearch one of the top competitors.

From the below statistics, we can observe the popularity of Elasticsearch year by year and regionally.

### Languages Used

The language used to develop the Elasticsearch is Java. It is an open source under the terms and conditions of the Apache License. There are many clients available who consume Elasticsearch. The main official clients who use Elasticsearch are Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Apache Groovy, Ruby and other many languages.

### Platform Used

Elasticsearch requires at least Java version of 1.8.0_131 or later version in the Java 8 release series to run their project. It supports only Oracleâ€™s Java and the OpenJDK. It is recommended to use same JVM version across all the Elasticsearch nodes and clients. They also tested running Elasticsearch successfully on the various platforms that are listed in their website. They also mentioned that it is also possible that it can work on other platforms that are not listed in their website.

[List of platforms page](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix) consists of list of platforms that supports Elasticsearch.

### Documentation Sources

The main features and other detailed information including the guidelines for installing Elasticsearch are explained in the [Elasticsearch documentation page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html).
The [lectures about the features of the Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/videos) page consists of all the videos about the products of the elastic.


### License

The core features in Elasticsearch are open source under the Apache 2.0 License, which is a permissive license from the Apache Software Foundation. Elastic also provides paid features, through their X-Pack subscriptions. The X-Pack features are also in the Elasticsearch GitHub repository; however, these are published under the Elastic License. So, while the X-Pack code is open, it is not truly open source because of the license.

### Procedure for making contributions

Elasticsearch is an open source project and so anyone can contribute their project through the GitHub source. Anyone can fork or clone their project from the GitHub through the [Elasticsearch GitHub page](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). Then they can make changes or add their new feature code to the project and run tests in the local machine. After testing fully, you can push and create pull request to the Elasticsearch. Then discuss the changes that you worked on with the elastic member. They will test the changes and if appropriate they will merge it to their master branch.

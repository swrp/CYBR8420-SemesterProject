Threat Model Analysis  
As indicated in several sections of the threat model, Elasticsearch has a fairly robust security solution provided by the X-Pack features.  When doing the analysis, these security features directly addressed the STRIDE threats in many cases.  When thinking specifically about the Internal Cluster Communication data flow, the security features included seem to be all encompassing from the documentation available.

Elasticsearch has methods to authenticate all cluster nodes, making spoofing very difficult unless a member of the cluster is compromised.  Some security features, like strong encryption of all traffic, cluster privileges and access controls certainly minimize Information Disclosure threats, but also could reduce tampering,  Whitelisting and dedicated networks specifically for cluster communication drastically reduce the risk of denial of service attacks. 

Audit log generation options are available to ensure integrity of the log files and repudiation threats.  There is event an event type in the Elasticsearch system called "tampered_request" that specifically is logged if a tampered search request is discovered.  Role based access control and the default behavior of not running the software as root, but rather with standard user access reduces the risk of elevation of privilege. Also, Elasticsearch has input validation, AD/LDAP integration which helps prevent repudiation. Disabling dynamic scripting helps prevent to Denial of Service attacks.

The threat model and analysis did not reveal any significant design issues.

**Top Claim 3: Elasticsearch defends against suspicious login activity.**
* **Evidence E1:** Elasticsearch has the flexibility to add filters that can detect successful [brute-force](https://www.elastic.co/blog/integrating-elasticsearch-with-arcsight-siem-part-4) login attempts within a window size of X-minutes. Once the conditions are met [alerts](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/watcher/current/actions.html#actions-email) actions can be configured to send emails to notify admin.
* **Evidence E2:** To prevent unauthorized login attempts to user accounts [multi-factor authentication](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-account-security.html) can be enabled. This adds an additional level of security which prompts for login credential's followed by a one-time password sent to the registered mobile.
